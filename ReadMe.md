# Welcome to the Inventor Automation Wiki

Whether you're just starting out with the Inventor API or you're a seasoned automation developer, this wiki is here to help you.

You'll find tutorials, code examples, and best practices for automating Autodesk Inventorâ€”everything from simple iLogic rules to advanced custom add-ins.

This is a **community-driven project**. Contributions are welcome and encouraged!
If you have improvements, examples, or corrections, please consider submitting a **pull request**.

> ðŸ’¬ Not familiar with GitHub or pull requests? No problemâ€”just open an **issue** and share your thoughts or suggestions there.

Letâ€™s make Inventor automation easier together!

## Collaboration with ChatGPT

The content in this wiki has been created through a collaborative process between the author and [ChatGPT](https://openai.com/chatgpt), a language model by OpenAI.

The author provides technical information, context, and goals for each articleâ€”usually as rough notes, outlines, or source code examples. ChatGPT then assists by:

* Structuring the content into a clear and logical flow
* Formatting the material in clean and consistent Markdown
* Enhancing readability by rephrasing explanations where helpful

All code examples are authored by the contributor, not generated by ChatGPT.

This collaboration accelerates the documentation process while helping ensure technical clarity and consistency.
